This study aims to investigate the following key objectives
in the context of optimizing data transfer performance in High-
Performance Networks (HPNs):
1) Evaluate whether AI-based tuning outperforms manual
BDP-based tuning.
Manual tuning often suffers from estimation errors that
lead to throughput collapse or buffer over-provisioning.
We compare this with machine learning-based tuning
approaches.
2) Assess the accuracy of machine learning in predicting
optimal buffer sizes under varying network conditions.
Leveraging models such as SVR and RFR trained on
empirical data (latency, bandwidth, loss), we evaluate
prediction effectiveness.
3) Measure the impact of AI-guided decision support
on user confidence and usability.
We examine whether AI recommendations improve
usersâ€™ confidence, reduce decision time, and yield more
consistent outcomes.
4) Validate empirical results against theoretical expectations.
